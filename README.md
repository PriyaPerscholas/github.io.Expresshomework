1.Greetings
Make a route '/greeting' that sends a generic greeting to the screen like "Hello, stranger".

Give the greeting route a param /:name

When hitting the route, the page should display a message such as "Hello, ", or "What's up, <name>", or "<name>! It's so great to see you!" (ex. hitting '/greeting/Jimmy-boy' should display Wow! Hello there, Jimmy-boy on the page).
  
2.Tip Calculator
Your app should have a route of '/tip' and it should expect 2 params. One should be total and one should be tipPercentage.

When hitting the route, the page should display how much your tip will be based on the total amount of the bill and the tip percentage. (ex. hitting '/tip/100/20' should display 20 on the page).
  

3.Magic Ball
  
Create a route of '/magic' that should expect a phrase in the URL that ask the Magic 8 ball a question.

So if the user hits that route and asks a question of "Will I be a Millionaire" (ex. '/magic/Will%20I%20Be%20A%20Millionaire') he should have return to him his question AND a random Magic 8 ball response (see the array below) on the screen.

We can't use spaces in the url, so we use %20 to express a space in the url.

So if the user hits that route and asks a question of "Will I be a Millionaire" he should get his question asked and a random Magic 8 ball quote on the screen.
  
  
4.Take one down and pass it around
  
Build an express application that enables users to count down the number of bottles of beer. Don't like beer? Pass around bottles of soda, kombucha, or milk etc.
  
/*
- On the home page (`get "/"`), users should see:
  - "99 Bottles of beer on the wall"
  - a link that says "take one down, pass it around"
  - this should link to `/98`, where the number represents the number of bottles left.
- When a number is given in the url (`get "/:number_of_bottles"`), users should see:
  - The number of bottles of beer on the wall (i.e. `98 Bottles of beer on the wall.`)
  - a link to "take one down, pass it around", where the href is number of bottles in the parameter minus 1.
- If there are 0 bottles left, do not show a link to "take one down"
  - Add a link to start over, which directs the user back to the home page.
